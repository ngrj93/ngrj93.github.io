            <p>Foresight (Ongoing) - This application aims at helping users to schedule their visits by suggesting days that are less likely to be crowded. 
            Users are able to select a time period within which they would like to visit an establishment/POI. 
            The application then presents projections of expected footfall on days within the range and suggests suitable days based on certain user preferences. UWP </p>
